# Displaying UFO sighting data on the web with JavaScript

## Overview

Here we've built a basic webpage using Bootstrap/CSS in order to demonstrate how Javascript can be used to display JSON data while being interactive for the user to filter what is shown.

Above is what our webpage looks like. We've utilized Javascript to allow the user filter out desired parameters and be displayed on the page. We've got all the data stored as a JSON and the code to loop through it accordingly. Obviously all of the UFO data is stored/visible on the webpage, however the usage of Javascript allowed us to create search parameters to find specific things in the large set of data.

## Summary

This site is a great example to demonstrate the functionality of JavaScript, and it's use for searching through data on a webpage. However additional coding/refactoring would need to be done to allow this site to adapt to otherwise dynamic data. Realistically datasets may have less/more key/value pairs, image files, data missing, etc. Our code is useful for demonstration purposes, but will likely need more work to create a more dynamic and functional website.
